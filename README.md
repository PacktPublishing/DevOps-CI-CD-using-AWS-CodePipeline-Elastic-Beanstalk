## About the Video Course
Automated Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) is a critical part of DevOps and is a skill that is in high demand. 
In this course, we will examine the subject in complete depth by walking through an example project and building a complex CI/CD pipeline on AWS. You will gain the following five extremely valuable and highly sought after skills:
Learn to conceptualize and design CI/CD pipelines for your own web applications
Deploy and scale web applications on Amazon's Cloud infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Build pipelines on Amazon's Cloud infrastructure using AWS CodePipeline
Learn advance topics such as Elastic Beanstalk Extensions and AWS Lambda to run custom actions in your CodePipeline, Monitor your automated CI/CD pipelines. DevOps and continuous integration / continuous deployment processes allows team to iterate often and innovate faster. After taking this course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. You will be able to confidently design a CI/CD pipeline for your own web applications. You will gain an in-depth understanding of AWS CodePipeline and AWS Elastic Beanstalk services.
